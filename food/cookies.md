Ingredients
-----------

- 250g plain flour
- 170g butter, melted
- 300g muscovado/brown sugar (275g if using golden syrup)
- 2 egg yolks
- 1/2 tsp of bicarb (don't overdo it!)
- 2 tbsp hot water
- 1-2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 2 tsp cinnamon
- 150g porridge oats
- 150g raisins

Method
------

1. Preheat the oven to 170 C / Gas mark 3. Grease baking trays or line with
   parchment.
2. In a bowl, sift together the flour, bicarb, salt, and cinnamon.
3. In another bowl, cream together the melted butter and sugar until well
   blended. (Suggestion: add 1tbsp golden syrup.)
4. Beat in the vanilla, egg yolk, and water until light and creamy.
5. Mix in the sifted ingredients until just blended.
6. Stir in the oats and raisins by hand using a wooden spoon.
7. Drop cookie dough onto the prepared baking trays, with each cookie around 4
   teaspoons (1 tbsp) of dough. Do not flatten the dough. Cookies should be
   about 8cm apart.
8. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are
   lightly toasted. Note that the cookies should be very soft when you take
   them out; they'll become firmer as they cool.
9. Cool on baking trays for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to
   cool completely.

Notes
-----

- More fat = flat, crispy
- Less fat = puffy, cakey
- Try bread/cake flour for less spread
- Bicarb: browner, flatter; baking powder: puffier, lighter
- Caster: crispier; mucavardo: softer, chewier
- Less sugar: puffier
- More egg: puffier, cakier (it's the white that does it!)
- Use just yolk for a crispier texture
- Use a thicker-bottomed baking tray to avoid the bottoms crisping too quickly
- Water: increases spread and crispiness

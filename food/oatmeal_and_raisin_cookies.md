Ingredients
-----------

- 250g plain flour
- 170g butter, melted
- 300g mucavardo sugar
- 2 egg yolks
- 1 tsp of bicarb
- 2 tbsp hot water
- 1-2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 tsp cinnamon
- 150g porridge oats
- 150g raisins

Method
------

1. Preheat the oven to 170 C / Gas mark 3. Grease baking trays or line with
   parchment.
2. In a bowl, sift together the flour, bicarb, salt, and cinnamon.
3. In another bowl, cream together the melted butter and sugar until well
   blended. (Suggestion: add 1tbsp golden syrup.)
4. Beat in the vanilla, egg yolk, and water until light and creamy.
5. Mix in the sifted ingredients until just blended.
6. Stir in the oats and raisins by hand using a wooden spoon.
7. Drop cookie dough onto the prepared baking trays, with each cookie around 4
   tablespoons of dough (for smaller cookies, drop 1 rounded tablespoonful and
   adjust baking time as necessary). Do not flatten the dough. Cookies should
   be about 8cm apart.
8. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are
   lightly toasted. Cool on baking trays for a few minutes before transferring
   to wire racks to cool completely.

Experiments
-----------

First attempt: had too many pages open in my browser; got confused. Used a
combination of the ingredients listed above with those from a different recipe,
and followed the method from a third recipe. Cookies were dry and cakey.

Second attempt: Took about 20 mins to cook. Delicious! Bit too much bicarb
though...

Notes
-----

More fat = flat, crispy
Less fat = puffy, cakey
Try bread/cake flour for less spread
Bicarb: browner, flatter; baking powder: puffier, lighter
Caster: crispier; mucavardo: softer, chewier
Less sugar: puffier
More egg: puffier, cakier (it's the white that does it!)
Use just yolk for a crispier texture
Use a thicker-bottomed baking tray to avoid the bottoms crisping too quickly
Water: increases spread and crispiness

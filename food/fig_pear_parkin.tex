\textbf{Fig and pear parkin} \emph{(courtesy of Waitrose)}

\begin{itemize}
\item 100g (4oz) butter

\item 200g (8oz) self-raising flour

\item 1tsp ground ginger

\item 1tsp bicarb of soda

\item 100g (4oz) rolled oats

\item 3 small ripe pears

\item 4 fresh figs

\item 150g (6oz) black treacle

\item 150g (6oz) golden syrup

\item 3 pieces stem ginger, chopped

\item 50ml milk

\item 1 egg, beaten

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Method}

Preheat oven to Gas Mk 3, 170C. Grease and line base and sides of a 28x24cm shallow baking tin.

Mix together flour, ginger and bicarb in a bowl. Place the oats in a food processor and lightly blend until coarse, then add to flour. Quarter and core the pears. Slice all the fruits into thin wedges and add half to dry ingredients. 

Heat the butter in a saucepan with the treacle, golden syrup and stem ginger until the butter has melted but the mixture isn't boiling. Remove from heat and stir in the milk, then the egg. Add to the flour mixture and mix together. Turn into the prepared tin and spread to the edges. 

Scatter with the remaining fruit. Bake for about 45 mins (mine needed a bit longer) until the centre feels firm to the touch. Serve warm or cold, on the same day. They recommend that you don't keep it for several days as you would with normal parkin because of the fruit inside. Freezes well, delicious warmed up!

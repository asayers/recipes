-----------

- 6 pork sausages + 100g thinly sliced prosciutto or bacon
- 2 eggs
- 125g plain flour
- 150ml milk + 150ml cold water
- 3 tbsp dripping or lard
- 1 tbsp wholegrain mustard
- salt and freshly ground black pepper

or

- 8 pork sausages
- 4 eggs
- 225g plain flour
- 250ml milk
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- salt and pepper

or

- 12 pork sausages
- 4 eggs
- 200g plain flour, sifted
- 170ml whole milk + 170ml ale
- 6 tbsp beef dripping or lard
- 2 tbsp wholegrain mustard

or

- 12 pork sausages – about 800g
- 4 eggs
- 300g plain flour
- 300ml milk
- 2 tbsp groundnut oil
- salt and pepper


Method
------

1. Whisk together the eggs, flour, milk, mustard and seasoning, beating out any
   little lumps of flour. The consistency should be about that of ordinary
   double cream, but no thinner. Rest for 15 minutes.
2. Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.
3. Carefully remove the skin from each of the sausages. Wrap each piece of
   skinned sausage meat in a piece of cured ham.
4. Put the dripping or lard in a roasting tin and leave it in the oven until it
   is smoking.
5. Pour in the batter - it will sizzle softly in the hot fat - then arrange the
   sausages in the batter.
6. Transfer the tin back into the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes until puffed
   and golden. Serve with brown onion and madeira gravy.

or

1. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C /gas mark 6.
2. Pour the oil into the bottom of a baking dish, and arrange the sausages over
   it in a single layer. Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven.
3. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, eggs and half of the
   milk until smooth. Gradually mix in the rest of the milk until a smooth
   batter is achieved. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Remove the sausages from the oven, and ladle the batter over them until the
   sausages are 3/4 covered. Return to the oven, and bake for 35 minutes, or
   until the centre is risen and browned. Don't worry if the underside seems
   slightly soft, as this is normal.

or

1. Preheat the oven to 220C. Heat half the fat in a frying pan over a medium
   heat and brown the sausages on all sides (this is labour-intensive but worth
   it).
2. Meanwhile put the eggs in a large bowl and beat, preferably with an electric
   hand whisk, until thick. Beat in the flour and milk alternately until
   smooth, then stir in the ale and mustard and leave to sit for 15 minutes.
3. Put the remaining fat in a roasting tin (mine's about 26cm x 21cm) and put
   in the oven to heat. Once the sausages are browned all over, and the batter
   has rested, take it out of the oven and put over a medium flame. Pour in the
   fat from the sausage pan, followed by the batter, which should sizzle as it
   hits the tin. Add the sausages and return to the oven.
4. Bake for about 35 minutes until well risen and golden, then serve
   immediately, preferably with good gravy and lots of peas.

or

1. Begin by making the batter, and to do this sieve the flour into a large
   bowl, holding the sieve up high to give the flour a good airing. Now, with
   the back of a spoon, make a well in the centre, break the egg into it and
   add some salt and pepper.
2. Now, measure the milk and 2 fl oz (55 ml) water in a measuring jug, then,
   using an electric hand whisk on a slow speed, begin to whisk the egg into
   the flour – as you whisk, the flour around the edges will slowly be
   incorporated. Then add the liquid gradually, stopping to scrape the flour
   into the mixture.
3. Whisk until the batter is smooth. Now the batter is ready for use, and
   although it's been rumoured that batter left to stand is better, I have
   never found this, so just make it whenever it's convenient. Now place the
   sliced onions in a bowl, add 1 teaspoon of the oil and the sugar and toss
   the onions around to get the lightest coating, then spread them on the
   baking tray.
4. Next arrange the sausages in the roasting tin, then place the onions on a
   high shelf in the oven, with the sausages on a lower shelf, and set a timer
   for 10 minutes. When the timer goes off, remove the sausages from the oven
   but leave the onions in for a further 4-5 minutes – they need to be nicely
   blackened round the edges. When they are ready, remove them and leave to one
   side.
5. Now place the roasting tin containing the sausages over direct heat turned
   to medium and, if the sausages haven't released much fat, add the tablespoon
   of oil. When the tin is really hot and the oil is beginning to shimmer – it 
   must be searing hot – quickly pour the batter in all around the sausages.   
   Immediately return the roasting tin to the oven, this time on the highest   
   shelf, and cook the whole thing for 30 minutes. Now make the gravy.         
6. When the toad is ready, it should be puffed brown and crisp and the centre  
   should look cooked and not too squidgy. Serve it immediately with the gravy ,
   and it's absolutely wonderful with mashed potato.

Method
------

1. Prepare the marinade: Crush the cardamom, cumin, and coriander. Add them
   along with the cloves, cinnamon, salt, and food colouring to the yoghurt.
   Cut the chicken breasts into chunks and add them to the marinade. Leave in
   the fridge for between 1 and 24 hours.
2. Chop the onion and green chilli peppers, crush the garlic, and grate the ginger.
3. Heat some oil and butter in the pan, and add some coriander seeds. Add in
   the onion, peppers, garlic, and ginger, along with some cardamom, cloves,
   turmeric, cumin, cinnamon, cayenne chilli, garlic, salt, pepper, lemon
   juice, and sugar.
4. After 5 mins, add in the chopped tomato and tomato puree. Add more butter if
   necessary. Fry until soft.
5. Take off the heat. When cool, pour the mixture into a blender. Remove the
   chicken from the marinade and place it in the pan. Add the remaining
   marinade to the blender and blend to a paste. Pour the sauce back into the
   pan and place on high heat.
7. Boil the chicken in the sauce. When it's cooked through, begin correcting
   the texture and flavour. Add cream to smooth the sauce out, and additional
   spices to improve the taste.
8. Destarch the rice and add it with salt and pepper to a pan of boiling water.
   Place naan breads in oven.
9. Make sure the chicken is cooked through. Decorate with a swirl of cream and
   coriander leaves and serve in the pan.

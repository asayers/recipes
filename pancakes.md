1.  Measure out the flour and add the other dry ingradients in a bowl.
2.  Make a well in the centre and add the egg.
3.  Stir the egg in the well, gradually incorporating the flour and adding milk to maintain a thick creamy consistency.
4.  Beat the batter to add air and remove lumps.
5.  Cut up the bacon into small (1") pieces.
6.  Preheat a thick-bottomed pan and add oil to thinly cover the pan.
7.  Ladle one or several pools of batter into the pan; they should spread to roughly 5" in diameter.
8.  Quickly press two rashers' worth of bacon into the top side of each panckake.
9.  Fry over a medium heat until the top side has formed bubbles and has lost its liquid sheen (usually around 3 mins).
10. Flip and leave for another minute or two; both sides should be golden brown.
11. Enjoy with butter or maple syrup.

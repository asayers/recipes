asayers' recipe book
====================

A list  of recipes written in  such simple and  explicit terms that even  I can
follow them.  You'll find a bias towards British comfort food which can be made
in  large quantities  without  too  much trouble.   There  are  a few  original
creations,  but most  entries  are derivative.   Pull  requests are  gratefully
received.

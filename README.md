Recipes
=======

This is a recipe book, written in markdown and stored in a git repository. It features a number of original creations, as well as derivative ones. If you like the recipes, feel free to fork it. If you have suggestions or improvements, pull requests will be gratefully received.

I am a terrible cook, so all recipes are presented in excruciating detail; anyone should be able to follow them. I recommend the pancakes and cookies as particularly delicious.
